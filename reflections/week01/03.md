  ##  What is my biggest tip when creating an influential design?
  Design is a large concept to tackle, but in my experience the biggest tip that has helped my design has been the use of shadows.In my beginnings I wasn't aware of the different ways to use shadow and how they can range in effectiveness. Too much shadow is just as bad as not enough, it can also convey weight in you apps.
  ## Resources for better design.
  The following are some of the examples I find very interesting and helpful for design:

  1\. https://color.adobe.com/create/image- adobe color helps with color matching and good themes.

  2\. https://www.sansfrancis.co/- This website has great photos, colors, inspiration, and fonts.

  3\. https://www.figma.com/file/vewXfmgWeQN9QCw9ELYdiI/Clone-Site?node-id=2%3A0- Figma is one of my favorites because it's fast,easy, and very nice for blocking out a concept. As well as it being very easy to present to others. 
  
  ## How design can influence your users.
  Design can make or break a webpage. Design allows the user to have a guided experience into the brand or application. And so if this design comes off rushed or outdated then the user will most likely assume the company isn't professional. The design of a webpage can establish a good relationship with the user and therefore making it easier for them to accept the application.
